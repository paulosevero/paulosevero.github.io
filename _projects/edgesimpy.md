EdgeSimPy has several abstractions for edge servers, network devices, and applications, and built-in models for user mobility, application composition, and power consumption.

An overview of EdgeSimPy use cases is shown in the figure below.

EdgeSimPy provides a set of unique functional abstractions (e.g., container registries, images, and layers) that replicate the application provisioning method of widely used platforms such as Docker, allowing seamless integration with repositories like DockerHub.
