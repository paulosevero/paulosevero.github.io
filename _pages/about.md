Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) in the Department of Computer Science at Federal University of Pampa (UNIPAMPA), Brazil.

As a scientist, Iâ€™m broadly interested in all aspects of resource management, and particularly in cloud computing and edge computing.

Previously, I completed my PhD in computer science from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS), where I was advised by prof. Tiago Ferreto and prof. Rodrigo Calheiros and worked on maintenance in edge computing infrastructures, supported by a research partnership between PUCRS and Dell.
